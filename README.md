# Software Construction

 This project is for personal self teaching purposes. It is adapted from [6.005 Software Construction on MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/index.html)
 My goal is to fill gaps in my understanding of the Art of Software Construction from one of the best Universities in the World. The original course uses Java *sigh as the programming language of instruction. I'll be using Typescript instead to learn it and to try avoid any [copyright infringements on Problem Sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/general/collaboration.html)
 You are free however to resuse any work, critic or review code in this repository. Comments are open.

## Getting Started

* [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

## Instructions

### Installing TypeScript

There are two main ways to get the TypeScript available for your project:

* Via npm (the Node.js package manager)
* By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins

Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript by default. If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it.

For npm users:

```bash

> npm install -g typescript

```

### Course plan

You may choose to follow the general course guideline i.e 2 sessions/ topics per week over 12 weeks.
Or at own pace.

## Problem Sets

* [ ] 0: Turtle Graphics
* [ ] 1: Tweet Tweet
* [ ] 2: Poetic Walks
* [ ] 3: Expressivo
* [ ] 4: Multiplayer Minesweeper

## Project

* ABC Music Player
