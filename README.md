# Software Construction

 This project is for personal self teaching purposes. It is adapted from [6.005 Software Construction on MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/index.html)
 The goal is to learn/relearn the Art of Software from one of the best Universities in the World. The original course uses Java *sigh as the programming language of instruction. I'll be using Typescript instead to learn is and to try avoid any [copyright infringements on Problem Sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/general/collaboration.html)
