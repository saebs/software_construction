# Software Construction

 This project is for self teaching purposes. It is based on the ojectives and reading material from the MIT Course [6.005: Software Construction](http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/)
The goal is to fill gaps in understanding and practise the Art of Software Construction from one of the best Universities in the World, and to learn Typecript while at it.

## Instructions

### Installing TypeScript

These are some ways to get the TypeScript available for your project:

* Via npm (the Node.js package manager)
* By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins
* By installing Intellij Rider IDE (Typscript support out of the box)

Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript by default. If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it.

For npm users:

```bash

> npm install -g typescript

```
